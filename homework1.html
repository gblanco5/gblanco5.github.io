	<div class="text1">My name is Geovani Blanco, I've taken web design classes in CSM in the past. Not many, of those classes, focused on the coding side of things, but rather building visually using adobe programs. I've lived in San Mateo all my life and have only ever traveled to two places outside of California!</div>
	</div>

	<p>I'm attending this class because I always found coding with html and css enjoyable and I wanted to pursue a career path that involved coding. I'm not knowledgeable in many other coding languages, but I'm usually able to find my way searching online and watching videos to learn how to get things done.</p>

	<h2>Technologies for this class</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>HTML</li>
		<li>CSS</li>
		<li>JavaScript</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Resources</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.htmldog.com/" target="_blank">HTML Dog</a> - This website offers a variety of resources for new and old Web Developers. The website is organized in four parts: tutorials, techniques, examples, and references. The tutorials are helpful to new developers trying to learn the coding language or older ones trying to brush up on some old skills. Techniques explain the ways different coding languages can be used together to achieve a common goal. The examples section brings code to life and gives the user a visual representation of what they are trying to accomplish. Lastly the references section has a list of all the tags organized by sections.</li>
		
		
		<li><a href="http://htmlcolorcodes.com/" target="_blank">HTML Color Codes</a> - This website is completely focused on colors. While it may seem extreme to have it listed as an important resource, I've found finding the perfect shade of a certain color can be extremely difficult if you are limited by simple color names such as "red." It's much more convenient to use a color picker to find the ideal color and have the html code of said color provided for your convenience.
